# HexagonWar

Basically, I 3D printed a board game and wanted to make an online version of it! With no knowledge of web dev, I coded this in babylon.js. Personally, I think it came out pretty well, but if I were to code it again, I would definitely be able to do a better job and do it much more quickly.

Click on the pieces to move them. The board game rules are not coded in, so its just a skeleton, a very muscular skeleton of the game.
